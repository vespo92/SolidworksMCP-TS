# Windows Test Suite for SolidWorks MCP Server

## Summary
We've identified that the winax module is loading correctly, but there's an issue with how we're accessing COM object properties/methods. Your previous tests showed that `GetTitle` exists but calling it as a method `GetTitle()` fails with "is not a function" error.

## Tests to Run on Windows

Please run these tests in order and share the complete output:

### 1. test-critical.js
**Purpose:** Understand the exact Dispatch object behavior and determine if GetTitle/GetType are properties or methods.
```bash
node test-critical.js
```

### 2. test-comprehensive.js  
**Purpose:** Test all SolidWorks API patterns comprehensively and save results to JSON.
```bash
node test-comprehensive.js
```
This will create a `test-results.json` file - please share this file.

### 3. test-mcp-operations.js
**Purpose:** Test the specific operations that the MCP server performs.
```bash
node test-mcp-operations.js
```

### 4. test-dispatch.js
**Purpose:** Debug winax Dispatch object behavior in detail.
```bash
node test-dispatch.js
```

### 5. test-working-pattern.js
**Purpose:** Test both ActiveXObject and winax.Object patterns to find what works.
```bash
node test-working-pattern.js
```

## What We Need to Understand

1. **Property vs Method Access**: Are `GetTitle`, `GetType`, `GetPathName` properties or methods?
2. **Return Values**: What do these actually return when accessed correctly?
3. **Working Pattern**: Which exact pattern works for accessing these values?
4. **Type Information**: What is the actual type of the returned values?

## Current Status

- ✅ winax loads correctly (v3.0.7)
- ✅ COM objects are created (not null)
- ✅ Properties like `Visible` work
- ❌ `GetTitle()` fails with "is not a function"
- ❓ `GetTitle` as property returns... what?

## Key Finding from Your Tests

From `test-com-null.js` output:
- `GetTitle` exists (`Has GetTitle method: true`)
- Calling `GetTitle()` fails (`GetTitle() error: sw.GetTitle is not a function`)
- The COM object is a Dispatch wrapper with properties: `__vars`, `__methods`, `__type`, `__value`, `__id`

## Next Steps

1. Run all 5 tests above
2. Share the complete output from each test
3. Share the `test-results.json` file from test-comprehensive.js
4. Based on results, we'll implement the correct pattern in v3.0.8

## Note on the Working Version

You mentioned you had it "100% working before". The Fixes-V2 code shows methods being called with parentheses (e.g., `GetTitle()`), but this doesn't match what we're seeing in tests. We need to understand:

1. Was there a different winax configuration?
2. Was ActiveXObject being used instead of winax.Object?
3. Is there a version-specific behavior?

Please run these tests with SolidWorks already open and share all outputs!
